# go-with-tests


- Write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure

- Writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software

- Then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with


Test should have a happy path, this is what we expect to see when the function completes "successfully"

There should be paths that also show how errors are handled and returned
